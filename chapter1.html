            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">CONNECTIONS TO YOUR TV</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Connect the computer to your TV as shown on page 4 of the manual.</p>
            <img src="images/c64-tv-switchbox.png" alt="Commodore 64 TV Switchbox" class="w-full mb-4 rounded-lg border">
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Attach one end of the TV cable to the phono type TV signal jack at the rear of the Commodore 64. Just push it in. Either end of the cable can be used.</li>
                <li>Connect the other end of the cable to the antenna switchbox. Just push it in.</li>                
                <li>If you have a VHF antenna, disconnect it from your TV set.</li>
                <li>Connect your VHF antenna cable to the screw terminals labeled "antenna input" on the switchbox. If your antenna cable is the round 75-ohm coax type, use a 75-ohm to 300-ohm adapter (not supplied) to attach your antenna cable to the switchbox.</li>
                <li>Connect the twin lead output cable of the antenna switchbox to the VHF antenna terminals of your TV set. If your set is one of the newer types with a round 75-ohm VHF connector, you will need a 300-ohm to 75-ohm converter (not supplied) to connect the switchbox to the 75-ohm VHF antenna input on the set.</li>
                <li>Set the TV's VHF tuner to the channel number indicated on the computer's channel selector switch (channel 3 move the switch to the left, channel 4 move the switch to the right). If a strong local TV signal is present on one of these channels, select the other channel to avoid possible interference.</li>
                <li>Plug the power supply cable into the power socket on the side of the Commodore 64. Just push it in. It is "keyed" to allow insertion in only one direction, so you can't connect the power cord the wrong way. The power supply converts household current into the form the computer uses.</li>
            </ol>

            <img src="images/c64-antenna.png" alt="Commodore 64 Antenna Connection" class="w-full mb-6 rounded-lg border">
            <p class="mb-4">The Commodore 64 is now correctly connected. No additional connections are required to use the computer with your TV. The antenna switchbox will connect the computer to the TV when the slide switch is in the "computer" position. When the switch is in the "TV" position your set will operate normally.</p>
            <img src="images/c64-antenna-switch.png" alt="Commodore 64 Antenna Switchbox Connection" class="w-full mb-6 rounded-lg border">

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">OPTIONAL CONNECTIONS</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Since the Commodore 64 furnishes a channel of high fidelity sound, you may wish to play it through a quality amplifier to realize the best sound possible. In addition, the Commodore 64 also provides a standard "composite" video signal, which can be fed into a television monitor.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">These options are made possible by the audio/video output jack on the rear panel of the Commodore 64. The easiest way to gain access to these signals is by using a standard 5-Pin DIN audio cable (not supplied). This cable connects directly to the audio/video connector on the computer. Two of the four pins on the opposite end of the cable contain the audio and video signals. Optionally, you can construct your own cable, using the pinouts shown in Appendix I as a guide.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Normally, the BLACK connector of the DIN cable supplies the AUDIO signal. This plug may be connected to the AUXILIARY input of an amplifier, or the AUDIO IN connector of a monitor or other video system, such as a video cassette recorder (VCR).</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The WHITE or RED connector usually supplies the direct VIDEO signal. This plug is connected to the VIDEO IN connector of the monitor or video input section of some other video system, such as a VCR.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Depending on the manufacturer of your DIN cable, the color coding of the plugs may be different. Use the pinouts shown in Appendix I to match up the proper plugs if you don't get an audio or video signal using the suggested connections.</p>
            <img src="images/c64-din-cable.png" alt="Commodore 64 DIN Cable" class="w-full mb-6 rounded-lg border">
            <p class="mb-4">If you purchased peripheral equipment, such as a VIC 1541 disk drive or a VIC 1515 printer, you may wish to connect it at this time. Refer to the user's manuals supplied with any additional equipment for the proper procedure for connecting it to the computer.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">OPERATION</h2>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">USING THE COMMODORE 64</h3>
             <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Turn on the computer using the rocker switch on the right-side panel when you're looking at the computer from the front.</li>
                <li>After a few moments the following will be displayed on the TV screen:
                    <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg my-4"><code>**** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
64K RAM SYSTEM 38911 BASIC BYTES FREE

READY.
â–‹</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>If your TV has a manual fine tuning knob, adjust the TV until you get a clear picture.</li>
                <li>You may also want to adjust the color and tint controls on the TV for the best display. You can use the color adjustment procedure described later to get everything setup properly. When you first get a picture, the screen should appear mostly dark blue, with a light blue border and letters.</li>
             </ol>
             <p class="mb-4">If you don't get the expected results, recheck the cables and connections. The accompanying chart will help you isolate any problem.</p>

                <p class="font-bold">TIP:</p>
                <p>The COMMODORE 64 was designed to be used by everyone. But we at Commodore recognize that computer users may, occasionally, run into difficulties. To help answer your questions and give you some fun programming ideas, Commodore has created several publications to help you. You might also find that it's a good idea to join a Commodore Users Club to help you meet some other COMMODORE 64 owners who can help you gain knowledge and experience.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">CURSOR</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The flashing square under READY is called the cursor and indicates where what you type on the keyboard will be displayed on the screen. As you type, the cursor will move ahead one space, as the original cursor position is replaced with the character you typed. Try typing on the keyboard and watch as characters you type are displayed on the TV screen.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">COLOR ADJUSTMENT</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">There is a simple way to get a pattern of colors on the TV so you can easily adjust the set. Even though you may not be familiar with the operation of the computer right now, just follow along, and you'll see how easy it is to use the Commodore 64.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">First, look on the left side of the keyboard and locate the key marked CTRL. This stands for ConTROL and is used, in conjunction with other keys, to instruct the computer to do a specific task.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">To use a control function, you hold down the CTRL key while depressing a second key.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Try this: hold the CTRL key while also depressing the 9 key. Then release both keys. Nothing obvious should have happened, but if you touch any key now, the screen will show the character displayed in reverse type, rather than normal typeâ€”like the opening message or anything you typed earlier.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Hold down the SPACE BAR. What happens? If you did the above procedure correctly, you should see a light blue bar move across the screen and then move down to the next line as long as the SPACE BAR is depressed.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Now, hold CTRL while depressing any of the other number keys. Each of them has a color marked on the front. Anything displayed from this point will be in that color. For example, hold CTRL and the 8 key and release both. Now hold the SPACE BAR. Watch the display. The bar is now in yellow! In a like manner you can change the bar to any of the other colors indicated on the number keys by holding CTRL and the appropriate key.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Change the bar to a few more different colors and then adjust the color and tint controls on your TV so the display matches the colors you selected.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">At this point everything is properly adjusted and working correctly. The following chapters will introduce you to the BASIC language. However, you can immediately start using some of the many prewritten applications and games available for the Commodore 64 without knowing anything about computer programming.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Each of these packages contains detailed information about how to use the program. It is suggested, though, that you read through the first few chapters of this manual to become more familiar with the basic operation of your new system.</p>
