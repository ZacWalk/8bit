                    <p class="mb-4">Congratulations, on your purchase of one of the best computers in the world. You are
                        now
                        the proud owner of the COMMODORE 64. Commodore is known as The Friendly Computer company, and
                        part
                        of being friendly is giving you easy to read, easy to use and easy to understand instruction
                        manuals. The COMMODORE 64 USER'S GUIDE is designed to give you all the information you need to
                        properly set up your equipment, get acquainted with operating the COMMODORE 64, and give you a
                        simple, fun start at learning to make your own programs.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">For those of you who don't want to bother learning how to program, we've put all the
                        information you need to use Commodore programs or other prepackaged programs and/or game
                        cartridges
                        (third party software) right up front. This means you don't have to hunt through the entire book
                        to
                        get started.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Now let's look at some of the exciting features that are just waiting for you inside
                        your COMMODORE 64. First, when it comes to graphics you've got the most advanced picture maker
                        in
                        the microcomputer industry. We call it SPRITE GRAPHICS, and it allows you to design your own
                        pictures in 4 different colors, just like the ones you see on arcade type video games. Not only
                        that, the SPRITE EDITOR let's you animate as many as 8 different picture levels at one time. The
                        SPRITE EDITOR will soon be available as a software program that you can load directly into your
                        COMMODORE 64. You can move your creations anywhere on the screen, even pass one image in front
                        of or
                        behind another. Your COMMODORE 64 even provides automatic collision detection which instructs
                        the
                        computer to take the action you want when the sprites hit each other.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Next, the COMMODORE 64 has built-in music and sound effects that rival many well
                        known
                        music synthesizers. This part of your computer gives you 3 independent voices, each with a full
                        9
                        octave "piano-type" range. In addition you get 4 different waveforms (sawtooth, triangle,
                        variable
                        pulse, and noise), a programmable ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope generator and
                        a
                        programmable high, low, and bandpass filter for the voices, and variable resonance and volume
                        controls. If you want your music to play back with professional sound reproduction, the
                        COMMODORE 64
                        allows you to connect your audio output to almost any high-quality amplification system.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">While we're on the subject of connecting the COMMODORE 64 to other pieces of
                        equipment
                        your system can be expanded by adding accessories, known as peripherals, as your computing needs
                        grow. Some of your options include items like a DATASSETTE* recorder or as many as 5, VIC 1541
                        disk
                        drive storage units for the programs you make and/or play. If you already have a VIC 1540 disk
                        drive
                        your dealer can update it for use with the COMMODORE 64. You can add a VIC dot matrix printer to
                        give you printed copies of your programs, letters, invoices, etc... If you want to connect up
                        with
                        larger computers and their massive data bases then just plug in a VICMODEM cartridge, and get
                        the
                        services of hundreds of specialists and a variety of information networks through your home or
                        business telephone. Finally if you're one of those people interested in the wide variety of
                        applications software available in CP/M**, the COMMODORE 64 can be fitted with a plug-in Z-80
                        microprocessor.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Just as important as all the available hardware is the fact that this USER'S GUIDE
                        will
                        help you develop your understanding of computers. It won't tell you everything there is to know
                        about computers, but it will refer you to a wide variety of publications for more detailed
                        information about the topics presented. Commodore wants you to really enjoy your new COMMODORE
                        64.
                        And to have fun, remember: programming is not the kind of thing you can learn in a day. Be
                        patient
                        with yourself as you go through the USER'S GUIDE. But before you start, take a few minutes to
                        fill
                        out and mail in the owner/registration card that came with your computer. It will ensure that
                        your
                        COMMODORE 64 is properly registered with Commodore Headquarters and that you receive the most
                        up-to-date information regarding future enhancements for your machine. Welcome to a whole new
                        world
                        of fun!!</p>
