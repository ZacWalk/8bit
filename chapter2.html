            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">KEYBOARD</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Now that you've got everything set up and adjusted, please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with the keyboard which is your most important means of communication with the Commodore 64.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">You will find the keyboard similar to a standard typewriter keyboard found in most areas. There are, however, a number of new keys which control specialized functions. What follows is a brief description of the various keys and how they function. The detailed operation of each key will be covered in later sections.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">RETURN</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The RETURN key signals the computer to look at the information that you typed and enters that information into memory.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">SHIFT</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The SHIFT key works like that on a standard typewriter. Many keys are capable of displaying two letters or symbols and two graphic characters. In the "upper/lower case" mode the SHIFT key gives you standard upper case characters. In the "upper case/graphic" mode the SHIFT key will display the graphic character on the right hand side of the front part of the key.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In the case of special YELLOW function keys, the SHIFT key will give you the function marked on the front of the key.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">EDITING</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">No one is perfect, and the Commodore 64 takes that into account. A number of editing keys let you correct typing mistakes and move information around on the screen.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">CRSR</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">There are two keys marked CRSR (CURSOR), one with up and down arrows, the other with left and right arrows. You can use these keys to move the cursor up and down or left and right. In the unshifted mode, the CRSR keys will let you move the cursor down and to the right. Using the SHIFT key and CRSR keys allows the cursor to be moved either up or to the left. The cursor keys have a special repeat feature that keeps the cursor moving until you release the key.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">INST/DEL</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">If you hit the INST/DEL key, the cursor will move back a space, erasing (DELeting) the previous character you typed. If you're in the middle of a line, the character to the left is deleted and the characters to the right automatically move together to close up the space.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A SHIFTed INST/DEL allows you to INSerT information on a line. For example, if you noticed a typing mistake in the beginning of a line—perhaps you left out part of a name—you could use the CRSR key to move back to the error and then hit INST/DEL to insert a space. Then just type in the missing letter.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">CLR/HOME</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">CLR/HOME positions the cursor at the "HOME" position of the screen, which is the upper left-hand corner. A shifted CLR/HOME will clear the screen and place the cursor in the home position.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">RESTORE</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">RESTORE operates as the name implies. It restores the computer to the normal state it was in before you changed things with a program or some command. A lot more will be said on this in later chapters.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">FUNCTION KEYS</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The four function keys on the right side of the keyboard can be "programmed" to handle a variety of functions. They can be defined in many ways to handle repetitive tasks.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The CTRL key, which stands for ConTROL, allows you to set colors, and perform other specialized functions. You hold the CTRL key down while depressing another designated key to get a control function. You had an opportunity to try the CTRL key when you changed text colors to create different color bars during the setup procedure.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">RUN/STOP</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Normally, depressing the RUN/STOP key will stop the execution of a BASIC program. It signals the computer to STOP doing something. Using the RUN/STOP key in the shifted mode will allow you to automatically load a program from tape.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">COMMODORE KEY</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The Commodore key performs a number of functions. First, it allows you to move between the text and graphic display modes. When the computer is first turned on, it is in the Upper Case/Graphic mode, that is, everything you type is in upper case letters. As was mentioned, using the SHIFT key in this mode will display the graphic on the right side of the keys.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you hold down the Commodore key and SHIFT key, the display will change to upper and lower case. Now, if you hold down the key and any other key with a graphic symbol, the graphic shown on the left side of the key will be displayed.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">To get back into the upper case/graphic mode hold down the key and SHIFT key again.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The second function of the key is to allow you access to a second set of eight text colors. By holding down the key and any of the number keys, any text now typed will be in the alternate color available from the key you depressed. Chapter 5 lists the text colors available from each key.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">BACK TO NORMAL</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Now that you've had a chance to look over the keyboard, let's explore some of the Commodore 64's many capabilities.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you still have the color bars on the screen from adjusting your TV set, hold SHIFT and CLR/HOME. The screen should clear and the cursor will be positioned in the "home" spot (upper left-hand corner of the screen).</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Now, simultaneously hold Commodore and the 7 key. This sets the text color back to light blue. There is one more step needed to get everything back to normal. Hold CTRL and 0 (Zero not Oh!). This sets the display mode back to normal. If you remember, we turned REVERSE type on with the CTRL 9 to create the color bars (the color bars were actually reversed spaces). If we were in the normal text mode during the color test, the cursor would have moved, but just left blank spaces.</p>

                <p class="font-bold">TIP:</p>
                <p>Now that you've done things the hard way, there is a simple way to reset the machine to the normal display. First press the RUN/STOP key and then press the RESTORE key. RUN/STOP must always be held down in order to use the RESTORE key function. This will clear the screen and return everything to normal. If there is a program in the computer, it will be left untouched. This is a good sequence to remember, especially if you do a lot of programming. If you wish to reset the machine as if it were turned off and then switched on again, type, <code>SYS 64759</code> and press RETURN. Be careful using this command! It will wipe out any program or information that is currently in the computer.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">LOADING AND SAVING PROGRAMS</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">One of the most important features of the Commodore 64 is the ability to save and load programs to and from cassette tape or disk. This capability allows you to save the programs you write for use at a later time, or purchase prewritten programs to use with the Commodore 64. Make sure that either the disk drive or datasette unit is attached properly.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">LOADING PREPACKAGED PROGRAMS</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">For those of you interested in using only prepackaged programs available on cartridges, cassette, or disk here's all you have to do:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li><strong>CARTRIDGES:</strong> To load these games, first turn on your TV set. Next turn OFF your Commodore 64. YOU MUST TURN OFF YOUR COMMODORE 64 BEFORE INSERTING OR REMOVING CARTRIDGES OR YOU MAY DAMAGE THE CARTRIDGE AND/OR YOUR COMMODORE 64! Third insert the cartridge. Now turn your Commodore 64 on. Finally type the appropriate START key as is listed on the instruction sheet that comes with each game.</li>
                <li><strong>CASSETTES:</strong> Use your DATASSETTE recorder. Make sure the tape is completely rewound. Then, just type <code>LOAD</code>. The computer will answer with <code>PRESS PLAY ON TAPE</code>, so you respond by pressing play on your datasette machine. The computer screen will go blank until the program is found. The computer will say <code>FOUND (PROGRAM NAME)</code> on the screen. Now you press down on the COMMODORE KEY. This will actually load the program. To stop the loading simply press the RUN/STOP key.</li>
                <li><strong>DISK:</strong> Using your disk drive, carefully insert the preprogrammed disk so that the label on the disk is facing up and is closest to you. Once the disk is inside close the protective gate. Now type <code>LOAD "PROGRAM NAME", 8</code> and hit the RETURN key. The disk will make noise and your screen will say: <code>SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME</code> then <code>LOADING</code> and finally <code>READY</code>. When the READY comes on, just type <code>RUN</code>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">LOADING PROGRAMS FROM TAPE</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Loading a program back from tape is simple. For tape, rewind the tape back to the beginning and type: <code>LOAD "PROGRAM NAME"</code>. If you don't remember the program name, just type <code>LOAD</code> and the first program on the tape will be loaded into memory. After you press RETURN the computer will respond with: <code>PRESS PLAY ON TAPE</code>. After you depress the play key, the screen will blank. When the program is found, the screen will display: <code>FOUND PROGRAM NAME</code>. To actually LOAD the program, depress the Commodore key. To abandon the LOADing procedure, hit RUN/STOP. After the LOADing procedure is completed, the screen will return to the normal state and the READY prompt will reappear.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">LOADING PROGRAMS FROM DISK</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Loading a program from disk follows the same format. Type: <code>LOAD "PROGRAM NAME",8</code>. The 8 is the code for the disk. After you hit RETURN the disk will start whirring and the display shows: <code>SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME</code>, then <code>LOADING</code>, then <code>READY</code>.</p>
            
            <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 text-yellow-700 p-4 my-4" role="alert">
                <p class="font-bold">NOTE:</p>
                <p>When you load a new program into the computer's memory, any instructions that were in the computer previously will be erased. Make sure you save a program you're working on before loading a new one. Once a program has been loaded, you can RUN it, LIST it, or make changes and re-save the new version.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">SAVING PROGRAMS ON TAPE</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">After entering a program, if you wish to save it on tape, type: <code>SAVE "PROGRAM NAME"</code>. "PROGRAM NAME" can be up to 16 characters long. After you hit RETURN the computer will respond with: <code>PRESS PLAY AND RECORD ON TAPE</code>. Press both the record and play keys on the datasette. After the program is saved on tape, the READY prompt will reappear.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">SAVING PROGRAMS ON DISK</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Saving a program on disk is even simpler. Type: <code>SAVE "PROGRAM NAME",8</code>. After you press RETURN the disk will start to turn and the computer will respond with: <code>SAVING "PROGRAM NAME"</code> then <code>READY</code>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">PRINT AND CALCULATIONS</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Try typing the following exactly as shown:</p>
            <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg my-4"><code>PRINT "COMMODORE 64"</code></pre>
            <p class="mb-4">If you make a typing mistake, use the INST/DEL key to erase the character immediately to the left of the cursor. You instructed the computer to PRINT whatever was inside the quote marks. By hitting RETURN you told the computer to do what you instructed and COMMODORE 64 was printed on the screen.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If the computer responded with <code>?SYNTAX ERROR</code>, ask yourself if you made a mistake in typing, or forgot the quote marks. The computer is precise and expects instructions to be given in a specific form.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">PRINT is one of the most useful and powerful commands in the BASIC language. With it, you can display just about anything you wish, including graphics and results of computations. For example, try the following:</p>
            <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg my-4"><code>PRINT 12 + 12</code></pre>
            <p class="mb-4">What you've discovered is that the Commodore 64 is a calculator in its basic form. The result of "24" was calculated and printed automatically. In fact, you can also perform subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and advanced math functions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 c64-blue">Arithmetic Operations</h3>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>ADDITION:</strong> The plus sign (+) signals addition: <code>PRINT 12 + 12</code></p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>SUBTRACTION:</strong> To subtract, use the conventional minus (-) sign. Type: <code>PRINT 12 - 9</code></p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>MULTIPLICATION:</strong> If you wanted to multiply 12 times 12, use the asterisk (*) to represent multiplication. You would type: <code>PRINT 12 * 12</code></p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>DIVISION:</strong> Division uses the familiar "/". For example, to divide 144 by 12, type: <code>PRINT 144/12</code></p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>EXPONENTIATION:</strong> You can easily raise a number to a power. The '↑' (Up arrow) signifies exponentiation. <code>PRINT 12↑5</code></p>
            
            <div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 my-4" role="alert">
                <p class="font-bold">TIP:</p>
                <p>BASIC has a number of shortcut ways of doing things. One such way is abbreviating BASIC commands (or keywords). A <code>?</code> can be used in place of <code>PRINT</code>, for example.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">PRECEDENCE</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The computer performs calculations in a certain order. The Commodore 64 performs calculations left to right according to the following:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Minus sign indicating negative numbers</li>
                <li>↑ exponentiation, left to right</li>
                <li>*/ multiplication and divisions, left to right</li>
                <li>+- addition and subtraction, left to right</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mb-4">You can alter the precedence process by using parentheses to set off which operations you want performed first. What is contained in the parentheses is evaluated first.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 c64-blue">COMBINING THINGS</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">You can combine the two types of PRINT statements. The first part prints a message exactly as it was typed. The second part does the actual work and prints the result, with the semicolon separating the message part of the statement from the actual calculation.</p>
            <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg my-4"><code>PRINT "5 * 9 = "; 5 * 9</code></pre>
            <p class="mb-4">You can separate the parts of a mixed print statement with punctuation for various formats. The semicolon causes the next part of the statement to be printed immediately after the previous part, without any spaces. The comma tabs each result into the next available 10-column area.</p>
